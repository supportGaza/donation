# donation

## Why do we select this idea ???

### When we participated in the work on the idea of ​​the project, we did not hesitate to work on it. The idea of ​​the project came to provide assistance to our families in Palestine, and we hope in the future to put real data inside it.

### Our first project, It was great experience with one of the best teams for ever.
### Violence and Terrorism in Palestine were not acceptable, no one can allow that, So we decided to assist our brothers and sisters there.

**This is the main goal of programming, to be human.**
### So we built this WebSite to donate and support them. It is just an idea today, but it will be one of the best company tomorrow.
