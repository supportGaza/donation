                <h2>Help them </h2>
                <p>Our community of supporters builds and renovates facilities to assist Gaza's people living with
                    disabilities.
                    Together we install water and sewage networks, so the streets are clean and dry, and homes have
                    reliable access
                    to water. We’re building preschools and training teachers so that Gaza’s children get the education
                    they deserve.</p>

                <p>We want to live like children in other countries who can go play in playgrounds ... why is this
                    happening to us?" - Khaled*, 10, Gaza Strip
                    More than 60 children in Gaza have been killed since 10 May. Houses have been turned into rubble,
                    schools and hospitals damaged and thousands of families ripped apart</p>

                        <p>we are continuing to do all that we can to support these vulnerable, impoverished people.
                           Together, we can work to rebuild Gaza and help Palestine; charity work and kind donations
                           can go a long way towards providing a brighter future for these disadvantaged people.</p>

                        <p>Heart-breaking scenes have been emerging from Palestine, as attacks on Palestinian worshipers at the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque were carried out during the final days of Ramadan. In addition, the city of Gaza was attacked with bombs that destroyed most innocent homes</p>
